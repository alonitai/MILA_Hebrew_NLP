Contains the tools developed by MILA - The Knowledge Center for processing Hebrew, Technion, ISRAEL
Added the Hebrew Lexicon in excel format -- does not include all fields. 
More coming.

Question: Git-hub did not allow me to download the inflections sql database, since it was too big (zipped to 38MB). How can I download it?
